       " 'my mortgage is with bb & t bank, recently i have been investigating ways to pay down my mortgage faster and i came across biweekly mortgage calculator on bb & t \\'s website. it\\'s a nice, easy to use calculator that you plug in your interest rate, mortgage amount, mortgage term, and payment type and it calculates your accelerated bi-weekly payment for you and shows you how much quicker you can pay down your loan. ours figured out to pay off a 30 year mortgage in 26.4 years ... quite a savings! \\r\\ni called bb & t \\'s customer service number to inquire how i get set up on this payment plan. i was told they do not offer that type of payment plan, but i could send in my payments bi-weekly but it would not be applied until the full amount was received. ( the money would sit in a \" holding account \\'\\' until the full payment amount was collected ). i ended up calling back a few days later thinking the rep i was talking to didn\\'t understand what i wanted to do or was not knowledgeable of this program. i got the same answer! \\r\\ni then asked for the corporate bb & t office number where i could speak to someone that was knowledgeable of this product. after 3 days i received a phone call back from a corporate manager stating they do not offer this product, and they were \" checking into why this is on their website \\'\\'. she stated they do have a few customers that make bi-weekly payments, but they no longer offer this service. \\r\\ni don\\'t understand how they can have this active link on their website under their financial planning center tab to mislead customers when all they say is \" i\\'m sorry, i know you\\'re upset about this \\'\\' sounds like false advertising to me! \\r\\nhttps : //www.bbt.com/xxxx',\n",
